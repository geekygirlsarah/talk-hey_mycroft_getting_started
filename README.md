# "Hey Mycroft": Getting Started with the OSS Home Assistant

## Abstract


Home virtual assistants, like Alexa, Google Now, Siri, and Cortana, are gaining a lot of popularity. They’re now incorporated into our phones, our laptops, and even available as separate devices in our homes. Some people haven’t adopted them out of privacy concerns. A new system called Mycroft has come onto the scene, and it’s built on open source hardware and software. You can install it on a Raspberry Pi, an old Linux box, or buy their own Mycroft device.

In this session, we’ll go over the basics of what Mycroft is, and how you can quickly install it yourself. From there, we’ll talk about some of the underlying software and see a short demo. Finally, we’ll see how to build a new skill into it and contribute it back to the community. You’ll leave with your own virtual assistant and the knowledge on how make it do what you want but keep your privacy in check.
